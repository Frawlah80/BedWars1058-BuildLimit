# BedWars1058-BuildLimit
An addon for BedWars1058. 
Sends a message to player when the player places a block over the build limit.

## The message it sends:
### "Build height limit reached!" in red color.

### The message is currently *not* configurable, but will decide to do so when I feel like it.
